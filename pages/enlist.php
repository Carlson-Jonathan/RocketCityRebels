                    Established in 2011 the Rocket City Rebels is Alabama’s 
                    first Junior Roller Derby team.  We are a co-ed team with 
                    skaters ranging from 8-18 years old who are dedicated to 
                    learning the sport.  We pride ourselves on building healthy 
                    bodies, minds and lifestyles for our skaters on and off the 
                    track.  Our coaches teach skaters respect not only 
                    themselves but their teammates, coaches, officials, fans 
                    and opponents. Roller derby is an inclusive sport that is 
                    open to players of all shapes, sizes, and athletic 
                    abilities. <br><br>
                    
                    The Rebels practice twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays 
                    from 6-8pm at Insanity complex. (100 Skate Park drive 
                    Madison Al, 35758).  Mondays are dedicated to skill and 
                    strength building drills and exercises while Wednesdays are 
                    set aside for Scrimmaging and game play practice. <br><br>
                    
                    Home games are typically played once a month from March 
                    through August. Most games are played by the “Charter” 
                    team (high level more experience players)  but we build 1 
                    or 2 team mixers per season that all skaters are invited 
                    to participate in.

                    The Rocket City Rebels hosts a 4-day Boot Camp once a 
                    year in the fall.  Boot 
                    Camp dates will be announced on our facebook page and will 
                    be listed on our <a href="../pages/schedule.php">calendar</a>.  
                    During this camp new skaters 
                    will be taught how to skate derby style and learn the basic 
                    rules of derby.  At the end of bootcamp all participants 
                    will be offered the opportunity to join the team.  After 
                    boot camp we typically offer open enrollment from October 
                    through January.
