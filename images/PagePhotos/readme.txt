* How to change images on each page:
*********************************************************************/
    The photos and images for each page are sorted into these folder. 
    You may change the pictures that appear on each page as you wish, 
    but the file name must remain the same. For example, if you want 
    to update the team picture on the skaters page to a more recent 
    group photo, access the "skaters" folder, delete the file named 
    "TeamPicture.jpg", and replace it with another image file with 
    the same name.
