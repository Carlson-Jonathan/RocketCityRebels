<h1>Rocket City Rebels Jr. Roller Derby Team Website</h1>
<p>In 2019 I created this website for my daughter's roller derby team, the Rocket City Rebels (see full website deployment on Heroku <a href="https://rocketcityrebels.herokuapp.com/">HERE</a>). This was intended to replace their existing website which much needed a makeover. For a time, it was adopted, but the team switched back to their previous website due to problems with the hosting company after they made a change to their service that prevented the site's PHP settings from working. To explore the administrative side of the website, click <a href="https://rocketcityrebels.herokuapp.com/pages/admin.php">HERE</a> and enter the password "<b>password</b>".</p>
