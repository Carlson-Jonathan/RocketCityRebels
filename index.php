                    Rocket City Rebels (formerly Rad Recruits) is a co-ed junior 
                    roller derby team in north Alabama for skaters ages 8 to 18 
                    who are dedicated to learning the sport. Coaches teach 
                    skaters to respect themselves, teammates, coaches, 
                    officials, fans and opponents. All of this knowledge is 
                    used to build healthy bodies, healthy minds, and healthy 
                    lifestyles on and off the track. Roller derby is a very 
                    physically and emotionally demanding sport. It is also a 
                    very rewarding and character building adventure.
