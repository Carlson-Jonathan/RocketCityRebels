                    Rocket City Rebels (formerly Rad Recruits) is a co-ed junior 
                    roller derby team in north Alabama for skaters ages 8 to 18 
                    who are dedicated to learning the sport. Coaches teach 
                    skaters to respect themselves, teammates, coaches, 
                    officials, fans and opponents. All of this knowledge is 
                    used to build healthy bodies, healthy minds, and healthy 
                    lifestyles on and off the track. Roller derby is a very 
                    physically and emotionally demanding sport. It is also a 
                    very rewarding and character building adventure.

                "Roller derby is a contact sport played by two teams of five 
                members roller skating counter-clockwise around a track. Roller 
                derby is played by approximately 1,250 amateur leagues worldwide, 
                mostly inside the United States. <br><br>

                Game play consists of a series of short match-ups (jams) in which 
                both teams designate a jammer (who wears a star on the helmet). 
                The jammer scores points by lapping members of the opposing team. 
                The teams attempt to hinder the opposing jammer while assisting 
                their own jammerâ€”in effect, playing both offense and defense 
                simultaneously.<br><br>

                While the sport has its origins in the banked-track roller-skating 
                marathons of the 1930s, Leo Seltzer and Damon Runyon are credited 
                with evolving the sport to its competitive form. Professional roller 
                derby quickly became popular; in 1940, more than 5 million 
                spectators watched in about 50 American cities. In the ensuing 
                decades, however, it predominantly became a form of sports 
                entertainment, where theatrical elements overshadowed athleticism. 
                Gratuitous showmanship largely ended with the sport's grassroots 
                revival in the first decade of the 21st century.[4] Although roller 
                derby retains some sports entertainment qualities such as player 
                pseudonyms and colorful uniforms, it has abandoned scripted bouts 
                with predetermined winners."
